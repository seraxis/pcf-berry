# pcf-spectrum-berry
Repo for Spectrum's berry font
This font seems to be increasingly hard to find these days, with the original author Spectrum [seemingly falling off the map](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3pqpor/who_is_the_author_pcf_font_berry/), so I'm trying to immortalise it here.

Let me know if it's uploaded somewhere else
